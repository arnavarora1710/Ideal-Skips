# Investigating the Impact of Skip Connections in Deep Learning Models

## Overview

This project aims to evaluate and analyze the role and impact of skip connections in deep learning models. Specifically, we will focus on their application within the context of stable diffusion models. By implementing various neural network architectures with and without skip connections, we aim to assess their effect on model accuracy, gradient signals, losses, stability, and overall performance across diverse independent datasets from different fields. Additionally, we will incorporate Markov chains to dynamically determine skip connections based on previous layer performance.

## Objectives

- Assess the effect of skip connections on model accuracy by implementing and comparing various neural network architectures with and without skip connections.
- Analyze the impact of skip connections on gradient signals, losses, and stability during the training process.
- Investigate the applicability and generalization of skip connections across independent datasets from different fields.
- Utilize Markov chains to dynamically select skip connections based on previous layer performance.
- Identify optimal skip connection configurations for different tasks and datasets by exploring various skip connection patterns, network architectures, and Markov chain parameters.
